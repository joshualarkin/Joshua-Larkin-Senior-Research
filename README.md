	The objective of this project is perform a comparative performance analysis of Open Source packet sniffing software 
against one another in order to determine which among them is the best to use for network administration. The types of 
factors that will be looked at are ease of installation, ease of use, amount of information gathered and how difficult it is to 
parse through. The tools that will be tested are WireShark, Suricata, and Snort.
